# JSON Schema for Tracks

# General principles

We will add what the standards for this schema are e.g. consistent use of case in keys, no reuse of keys unless they have the same meaning.

# The Schema

```json
{
}
```

# Keys and meaning

|Key|Meaning|Type|Example|
----|-------|----|-------|
| a_key | This key does X | String | `"a_key" : "A value"`|
